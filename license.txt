The license for XIO is pending, as it's not as important to me as getting some initial feedback. It will definitely be an 
attribution-based license. If you use xio.js as-is, unchanged, with the comments at top, you definitely may use it for 
any project. I will drop in a license (probably Apache 2 or BSD or Creative Commons Attribution or somesuch) in the 
near future.
